Protocol Transformer for MQTT and TCP

This repository demonstrates the use of MQTT for transmitting GNSS data by leveraging a protocol transformer. The project integrates Python with the Paho MQTT library, Mosquitto broker, and RTKLIB to facilitate seamless data conversion and transmission. It serves as a practical example for developers interested in combining MQTT with GNSS workflows for real-time applications.

Further descriptions and usage instructions can be found in the repository's Wiki.
